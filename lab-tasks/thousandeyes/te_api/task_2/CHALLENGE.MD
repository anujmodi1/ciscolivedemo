->Devops Workflow
->Working with JSON output from the Thousand Eyes API

Refer to the Thousand Eyes API Documentation here:

Edit line 30
Using the test name you created in task_1, update the python script to return the test id of the test (line 30)

rename this file to include your name and update the filename in the shell script
(This step will validate that you understand how the shell script is launched on the build container)

Check the URL for the api in the python script is correct - check the api documentation here under test update
https://developer.thousandeyes.com/v6/tests/#/test_metadata

After you run the task, check in the API to see your test metadata has been updated.

Challenge 2 - Advanced - Time Permitting at Instructor Discretion 
=======================
